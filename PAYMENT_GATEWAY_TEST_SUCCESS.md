## Important Notes

### Currency Support

⚠️ **Note**: Stripe doesn't natively support PHP (Philippine Peso)

**For Testing:**
- Tests used **USD** instead of PHP
- This is normal for testing Stripe integration
- Payment intents were created successfully with USD

**For Production:**

You have three options:

1. **Use USD with Conversion** (Recommended for Stripe)
   - Convert PHP to USD before creating payment intents
   - Display amounts in PHP to users
   - Process payments in USD

2. **Use PayMongo** (Recommended for Philippines)
   - Native PHP support
   - Local payment methods (GCash, PayMaya, etc.)
   - Better suited for Philippine market
   - You can add PayMongo as another gateway option

3. **Use Both**
   - Stripe for international customers
   - PayMongo for local customers
   - Switch between them based on customer location

## Next Steps

### 1. ✅ Gateway is Ready
Your payment gateway is fully configured and working!

### 2. 🚀 Integrate Payment Processing

You can now:
- Create payment intents in your views
- Handle payment confirmations
- Process refunds
- Set up webhooks for automatic updates

### 3. 🧪 Test with Stripe Test Cards

Use these test cards in your frontend:

**Success:**
- Card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/25)
- CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)

**Decline:**
- Card: `4000 0000 0000 0002`

**3D Secure:**
- Card: `4000 0025 0000 3155`

### 4. 📱 Add Webhooks (Optional)

Set up webhooks to automatically:
- Update order status when payment succeeds
- Handle payment failures
- Process refunds

### 5. 🔄 Consider Adding PayMongo (Optional)

For better PHP support:
- Add PayMongo as a payment gateway option
- Support local payment methods
- Better for Philippine customers
