# Payment Service Implementation - Complete ✅

## Summary

The payment service infrastructure has been successfully created with admin-configurable payment gateway selection!

---

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **PaymentGateway Model**
- New model in `transactions/models.py`
- Stores gateway configuration (API keys, test/live mode)
- Only one gateway can be active at a time
- Supports: Stripe, PayMongo, PayPal, Square, DragonPay, Cash on Delivery

### 2. **Payment Service Architecture**
- Abstract base class (`BasePaymentService`)
- Stripe implementation (`StripePaymentService`)
- Factory pattern (`PaymentGatewayFactory`) for easy gateway switching

### 3. **Admin Interface**
- Payment Gateway management in Django admin
- Visual indicators (Active/Inactive, Test/Live mode)
- Easy activation/deactivation
- Configuration status indicators

### 4. **Dependencies**
- Added `stripe==7.0.0` to `requirements.txt`

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install stripe==7.0.0
```

### Step 2: Create and Run Migration

4. **Save**

### Step 4: Get Stripe Test Keys (FREE)

## 🎯 How Admin Can Switch Gateways

### To Switch from Stripe to Another Gateway:

1. **Add New Gateway**:
   - Go to Admin → Payment Gateways
   - Click "Add Payment Gateway"
   - Select gateway type (e.g., "PayMongo")
   - Enter API credentials
   - Save

2. **Activate New Gateway**:
   - Select the new gateway in the list
   - Click "Activate selected gateway" from Actions dropdown
   - Old gateway automatically deactivated

### Visual Indicators:

- **Green dot** = Active gateway
- **Orange "TEST MODE"** = Safe to use, no real money
- **Red "LIVE MODE"** = Real transactions, be careful!
- **Green checkmark** = Properly configured
- **Red X** = Missing credentials

---

## 🔧 Code Usage

### Get Active Payment Service:

```python
from transactions.services import PaymentGatewayFactory

# Get active payment service
payment_service = PaymentGatewayFactory.create_service()

# Or get specific gateway
from transactions.models import PaymentGateway
gateway = PaymentGateway.objects.get(name="Stripe Test")
payment_service = PaymentGatewayFactory.create_service(gateway)
```

### Create Payment Intent:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

result = payment_service.create_payment_intent(
    order=order,
    amount=Decimal('1000.00'),
    currency='PHP'
)

# Use result['client_secret'] for Stripe frontend
# Or result['redirect_url'] for redirect-based gateways
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

**Current Implementation:**
- API keys stored in database (plain text)
- Suitable for development/testing

**For Production:**
- Consider encrypting API keys
- Use environment variables
- Implement key rotation
- Audit log access to keys

---

## 📝 Next Steps (Future Implementation)

1. **Payment Views**:
   - Create checkout page
   - Payment form
   - Payment confirmation

2. **Webhook Handlers**:
   - Stripe webhook endpoint
   - Payment status updates
   - Automatic order updates

3. **Additional Gateways**:
   - PayMongo implementation
   - PayPal implementation
   - Cash on Delivery handler

4. **UI Integration**:
   - Payment method selection
   - Payment status display
   - Payment history

---

## ✅ Current Status

- ✅ Payment gateway model created
- ✅ Admin interface implemented
- ✅ Stripe service implemented
- ✅ Factory pattern implemented
- ✅ Documentation created

**Ready for**: Gateway configuration and testing!

---

## 🎉 You Can Now:

1. ✅ Configure payment gateways through admin
2. ✅ Switch between gateways easily
3. ✅ Test with Stripe (free test account)
4. ✅ Add more gateways later (just implement service class)
